Greetings people,

I'm taking this occasion to give my opinion on promoting conspiracy theories. It is a subject constantly present in the last years, nevertheless, more and more worrying in the current context.

Let's talk about John.  
John is not a bot but a real person with a real Facebook account.  
John started sharing news on Facebook which, mildly speaking, we could call it as doubtful.  
John will tell you that he has the freedom of speech.  
John claims that his idea is the right one and everyone else is wrong.  
However, better don't be like John.

Do I consider as unacceptable to promote outrageous information ?  
Yes.

Would I like to contribute to stopping the propagation of such information ?  
Of course !

Will my instinct tell me to react violently in order to stop him ?  
Most probably.

Will such a reaction be helpful ?  
No.

Finding a dispute on Facebook which ends with _Yes, I think you're right_ is something extremely rare maybe even non-existent. Personally, I have never found such a pearl.

What did push John to this behavior ?  
Bear in mind that I don't claim building a full picture of the situation. I would just like to outline some ideas which I discovered through my reading and hopefully they will give us some hints on understanding John and on adapting our response to him.

A conspiracy related context inspires John with a feeling of **intellectual superiority** and the idea that he possesses the truth which was hidden to the uninformed masses. On this subject, the writer Mark Manson does an interesting comparison: the situation is similar to the one when people _root for the underdog in sports, or they pick the most obscure film or band to be their favorite music_. Exclusivity leads to a feeling of importance and attacking these ideas triggers a snowball effect; the feeling of importance intensifies while the critics start to flow.
To satisfy his need of superiority, John will take advantage of the ease of sending information. Sharing information became scalable. Never before in history has a person had the chance to share his thoughts to a theoretically unlimited number of people through social media. And it is made to be so easy that we tend to forget the responsability that comes with this act. No need to prepare a speech, to do publicity, to gather a crowd, to keep the public's attention. Spreading your conviction to the world is just a share button away.

A further interesting point of view is the way we perceive information. We have the tendency to search confirmation of our ideas and we are automatically doubtful when faced to elements which might contradict our opinions. This way of acting in front of information is often mentioned in the literature as the **confirmation bias**. Leo Tolstoy states it through a more direct example: _The most difficult subjects can be explained to the most slow-witted man if he has not formed any idea of them already; but the simplest thing cannot be made clear to the most intelligent man if he is firmly persuaded that he knows already, without a shadow of doubt, what is laid before him._ Consequently, John might arrive in a situation in which counter-evidence (be it also a scientific fact) is difficult to accept. In a way or another, we are all prone to this behavior.

Talking about social media, another factor is the democratization of access to information. The quantity of information rises exponentially to the detriment of the quality. It is currently impossible to have an autonomous system evaluating quality and the regulations are not at the level of the current situation. In such a wild west, **a critical mind and a level of discernment** are vital but they are unfortunately far too often neglected or nonexistent. And even if John would try to make use of it, there is a high possibility that his critical thinking is not applied correctly leading to a fall into the confirmation bias. Lastly on this aspect, doing a rigorous fact check is a time consuming task which requires having some trustworthy site references.

Another characteristic could be the existence of an internal fight, a desire to understand and to find answers. In other words, **a need for certainty**. At first sight, this attitude seems to be a perfectly healthy one. Things change when the need of certainty leads to finding culprit for everything. Man is uncomfortable with a state of randomness in which the sincere response is _we don't know_. We were thought to always find explanations, to build the past from facts and to forecast the future from estimations. Humanity didn't recently confront itself with such a state of uncertainty. Our recent past induced the idea that normal means stability. In this scenario, you might identify John with acquaintances from whom you didn't expect such a deviation in their behavior.

Until now, we looked at John's behavior from an individual's perspective. Let's take now into account his **social context**. John's action could be tightly related to the ideas of a community he is part of. So when you question his belief, you challenge the ideas of his social environment. The more his life is tightly linked to this community, the more John will stick to his opinions. The affiliation to a group often comes with a set of trade-offs. The flip-side is to give up his belief but this can lead to being socially abandoned and trigger loneliness and fear. The tighter the link, the more vulnerable John will be in case of exclusion. Not to mention that some communities have very harsh rules for such a scenario. So, in some cases, giving up ideas is strongly influenced by the social context of the person. When facing John who is in such a situation, keep in mind the following quote of Haruki Murakami: _always remember that to argue and win is to break down the reality of the person; it is painful to lose your reality._

The last thing I would like to point out is a couple of suggestions on how to react in front of John. Social integration in a new community brings a higher chance that John could be positively influenced without having to handle the exclusion risks. To go a step further, friendship is an even healthier way to impact someone's ideas. Trust and kindness which are some of the pillars of friendship will give John assurance that the change will be less painful than how Murakami described it. To quote the writer James Clear: **_Be kind first, be right later_**. However, it is a long process with a lot of uncertainty and I am clearly not in a position to blame someone who doesn't want to act accordingly. I could only blame me and act better next time. Last but not least, don't force push information but instead act like planting some seeds which will give John the necessary space to create his own opinion. And this is also how I hope this article will impact you: a set of debatable ideas which will trigger your critical thinking (and kindness) on this subject.

Thank you very much for spending your valuable time on reading my text and I would like to end with the following quote by Abraham Lincoln: _I don't like that man. I must get to know him better._
