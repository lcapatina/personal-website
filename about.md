I'm currently working as a Research Architect @ MantuLab, a team focused on applying the latest research from the data field in building solutions both for Mantu Group as well as for external clients.


Raised in a scientific background in Romania, focused on learning several foreign languages, lived throughout my studies in several countries of Europe, I eventually graduaded with a Msc as a Computer Science Engingeer from INSA Lyon.


My desire is to bring a contribution to a healthy and sustainable development of our society.


Problem solving is one of my main skills, having always the will to analyze and tackle a poblem from diverse angels.


I have an interest in topics like digital sobriety & ecological footprint, ethical investment, zero waste actions, contemporary history of Romania, stoicism, yoga & meditation.
