K8s goes way beyond deploying applications. We can also install other sofwtare pices which can handle different aspects not present by default in the k8s installation. 
An example is adding a `cert-manager` which will handle the connection with certificate issuers like Letsencrypt. In order to do so, we can use `Helm` the package manager of k8s (the process can be found [here](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/helm/#prerequisites)). The installation will add an existing chart for `cert-manager` in our local repository and will install a new `namespace` in the k8s environment. In other words, after installation, we will be able to list all cert managers configurations using `kubectl get cert-manager`

Deploymening the website with a self signed certificate requires generating one locally using openssl. For ex: `openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -sha256 -nodes -keyout tls.key -out tls.crt -subj "/CN=pwebsite.test" -days 365`. The resulted files, `tls.key` and `tls.crt` need to be added in a k8s secret: `kubectl create secret tls ingress-local-tls --cert=tls.crt --key=tls.key`. Once added, we can reference them in the helm template inside the ingress configuration.
